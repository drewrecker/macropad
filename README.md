## Drew's Macropad repository

I recently purchased an Adafruit MacroPad (https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128) and I wanted to keep a repository of some of my custom macros I created so that in case I need to reset my Macropad, I have an updated repo of the Macros I like to use.

## Macros:

1. Windows | Google Chrome
2. Windows | Microsoft Edge
3.
