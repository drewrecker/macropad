# Drew's Macropad repository

I recently purchased an Adafruit MacroPad (<https://www.adafruit.com/product/5128>) and I wanted to keep a repository of some of my custom macros I created so that in case I need to reset my Macropad, I have an updated repo of the Macros I like to use.
This will be a running list of the custom Macros I setup to be able to use between MacOS and Windows 10 (Some Windows 11 too).

## Windows Macros

* Microsoft Visual Studio Code
* Google Chrome

## MacOS Macros
